# Hi there

Welcome to my personal page, giving information and resources about recent and
past projects, and open-source work.

If you are interested in collaborating, do not hesitate to <a href="mailto:{{ site.email }}">get in touch with me</a>.

You can check out recent posts over at [posts](/posts).

## Recent Projects

### [DATE N' RULE](https://datenrule.com)

A narrative game based on [UNDERTALE](https://undertale.com/) created to propose
to my girlfriend, built using [Tweego](https://www.motoslave.net/tweego/) and
[Snowman](https://videlais.github.io/snowman/2/) story format.

### [Yogi's Choice](http://yogischoice.co)

An open database of yoga classes, built using [Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/).

Yogi's Choice spreads the diversity and love of yoga by easily helping you find
a class, style, or teacher across dozens of studios.

You can even compare timetables across studios, so there's no more need to have
five browser tabs in order to find the right class.

You can find the code for the [class scraper](https://github.com/joncinque/class-scraper) 
and [frontend](https://github.com/joncinque/aggregate-class-calendar) on GitHub.

### [pomo.fish](https://github.com/joncinque/pomo.fish)

A terminal pomodoro timer with desktop and sound notifications, created 
entirely as a [fish shell](https://fishshell.com/) script.

Simply kick it off for your desired amount of time and you will get a 
notification at the end of your pomodoro (25 minutes by default).

Check out the [project page](https://github.com/joncinque/pomo.fish) for more 
information and how to install, use, and customize it.

### [Cryptocurrencies and APIs](/cryptocurrency)

A presentation given to kick off the Bloomberg cryptocurrency hackathon and as 
a Recurse Center talk, giving the background on the rise of cryptocurrencies,
seen through the lens of Bitcoin and Ethereum.

Additionally, it provides information on how to use a popular cross-exchange
REST API library called [ccxt](https://github.com/ccxt/ccxt), allowing you to
automate cryptocurrency exchange trading.

Slides were created using [reveal-md](https://github.com/webpro/reveal-md), and
can be found [here](/cryptocurrency).
